    <h1>My World</h1>
    <p>I guess the best way to describe me is wondering nomad. Ideally I would want to continue working remotely but as a contrator providing services for web development while also creating more content through social media</p>
    <p>My current role allows me the flexibility to travel throughout canada but not other parts of the globe. Ive travel many places so far but ideally im planning on renting out my home and living out of a suitcase. This year ive travelled to Montreal AKA REAL CITY twice stayed a month during holidays a week in april. In june my partner and I travelled to west coast staying in vancouver and seattle for quick road trip. I came back from europe 3 weeks ago and seen 10 + cities. </p>
    <p>Last year I lived in mexico specifically Puerto vallarta for over 6 months I travel most of the coast of Nayarit staying in beautiful beach towns just to enjoy the local atmosphere and authentic culinary. Around october, 4 months after being there meet up with my toronto girlfriend in Houston (for under 200$) and stock up on some good old american goods. Spent a few days partied it up african american style and headed to tulum and that was really something. I would definetly say each mex state has its own charms. I returned to Oh Canada my home and inflated land and next day was off Hawaii for the second time. Safe to say travelling is my life and I accept my travel bug without any resistance.
